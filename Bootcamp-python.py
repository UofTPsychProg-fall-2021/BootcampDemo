Use python to calculate:
83 multiplied by 76
5 to the power of 3

Use python to determine 
if 81 multiplied by 12 is greater than 2000
if 435 divided by 5 is less than 90
if at least one of the above inequalities is false

use indexing to find the second value stored in list a

use slicing to get the first and last values stored in list a

replace the final element in list data with list a

*Advanced* use indexing to find the second value stored in the first element of list data
